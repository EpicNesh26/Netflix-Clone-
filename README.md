# Netflix Clone 

## I've recently embarked on an exciting project: crafting a Netflix clone from scratch using just HTML and CSS. Currently, the focus has been on replicating the frontend aesthetics of Netflix, striving to capture its sleek design and user-friendly interface. However, it's worth noting that JavaScript functionalities are yet to be integrated into the project. Additionally, the current version lacks responsiveness, but fear not, as enhancing its adaptability across various devices is high on the to-do list. 

# Note : This was also just a practice project to practice my HTML And CSS skills and to learn how to actually build a website.
